# Reinforcement-Learning-grid-world-finding-the-best-path

Finding the best path using RL methods such as:
- On-policy and Off-policy Monte-Carlo
- Double Q learning
- Tree Back-up
- SARSA
- Two-step Expected SARSA

The project was submitted as homework for the RL class-2020 (grid_world_env.py is used with permission)

evaluator_mdp.py is used to generate all the figures automatically
